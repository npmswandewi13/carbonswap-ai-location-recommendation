# 🌱 CarbonSwap: Plantation Location Recommendation API

**CarbonSwap** is a digital marketplace that connects companies with credible NGOs to simplify the carbon offset process in a transparent and measurable way.

This repository contains one of CarbonSwap's AI-powered features — the **Plantation Location Recommendation API**.  
It provides intelligent insights for users to identify and rank plantation sites based on both **project performance** and **socio-ecological indicators**.  
This API will be deployed on **Render** and integrated into the **CarbonSwap Web Dashboard**.

## 🏢 CarbonSwap Overview

### 🌍 Problem Statement

Between **2019 and 2023**, greenhouse gas emissions from Indonesia's industry sector increased by **16.25%**, while household emissions rose by only **1.29%**.  
Globally, CO₂ concentration growth rates have tripled since the 1960s — from **0.8 ppm/year** to **2.4 ppm/year (2011–2020)**, with **a record 3.5 ppm increase in 2023–2024**.

Indonesia holds vast potential to offset emissions through its forests and conservation areas, capable of absorbing **hundreds of billions of tons of CO₂**.  
However, companies still face major challenges in fulfilling ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) responsibilities:

1. Difficulty identifying credible NGOs.  
2. Lack of transparency and real-time monitoring.  
3. Complex ESG compliance and documentation.

## 🌿 Plantation Location Recommendation Feature

This API is designed as an **insight feature** within CarbonSwap to recommend the best plantation locations based on multiple performance and ecological factors.  
It analyzes project data from `location.csv` and ranks each location using a weighted scoring system.

### 🧩 Indicator Categories
